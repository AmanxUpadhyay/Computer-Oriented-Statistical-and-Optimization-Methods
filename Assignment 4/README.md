# Assignment 4

Write a program to find the range, mean deviation about mean, mean deviation about median and standard deviation from a set of n observations. The value of n and the observations should be taken by the user.

## ****How to Find the Range of a Data Set | Formula & Examples****

In statistics, the **range**  is the spread of your data from the lowest to the highest value in the distribution. It is a commonly used measure of [variability](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/variability/). The range is calculated by subtracting the lowest value from the highest value. While a large range means high variability, a small range means low variability in a distribution.

$ Formula Range = Highest value - Lowest value $

## ****How to Find the Mean deviation about mean of a Data Set | Formula & Examples****

The mean deviation is defined as a statistical measure that is used to calculate the average deviation from the mean value of the given data set. The mean deviation of the data values can be easily calculated using the below procedure.

1. Find the mean value for the given data values.
2. Now, subtract the mean value from each of the data values given (Note: Ignore the minus symbol)
3. Now, find the mean of those values obtained in step 2.

$ Range = (n1 + n2 + n3 + ... + nN) / N $

$ Absolute Deviations = { (n1 - Range) + (nN - Range) } $

$ Mean Deviation = Absolute Deviations / N $
