To find the frequency of the class limits based on the scores of 40 students.

> 25, 80, 83, 39, 65, 69, 64, 73, 37, 62, 53, 62, 73, 55, 77, 78, 52, 54, 62, 75, 85, 57, 56, 53, 50, 84, 39, 42, 79, 48, 49, 29, 45, 34, 68, 73, 32, 89, 78, 21

Tabulate the scores into frequency distribution using class interval of 10 units starting from score 20.

### Approach

1. Find the Lowest and Highest Frequency from the raw data.
2. After it we can iterate through the data accordingly.
3. Whenever we encounter number between the range we can store it in vectors, list, which ever is easy.
4. After that we will end up with 8 Frequency and their ranges
5. We can display the Result.
